Hi, My name is m1tZ! I have been involved in the cyber security scene for almost 4 years and landed a job as a **cyber security professional** 2 years ago. I ever was impressed about how things really work in the background and how someone could use that knowledge to break the code and the logic. Thus, it was pretty clear to me that I have to be part of the good hackers and try to make the world a more secure place. This is why I started bug bounty hunting almost 1 year ago.
