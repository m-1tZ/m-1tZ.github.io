Hi, My name is m1tz! I have been involved in the cyber security scene since 2019 and landed my first job as a **cyber security professional** in 2021. I ever was impressed about how things really work in the background and how someone could use that knowledge to break code and application logic. Thus, it was pretty clear to me that I have to be part of the white hat hackers and try to make the world a more secure place. This is why I started bug bounty hunting back then in end of 2021.

Hello, I'm m1tz, a cybersecurity professional with a deep passion for understanding how technology works beneath the surface. My journey into the cybersecurity world began in 2019, driven by a fascination with the inner workings of systems, applications, and protocols - how they can be secured or, at times, exploited.

In 2021, I officially transitioned from enthusiast to professional, starting my first role in the cybersecurity industry. From the beginning, I’ve been captivated by the logic behind systems and the subtle flaws that, when uncovered, reveal serious vulnerabilities. This curiosity naturally led me toward ethical hacking and the bug bounty space.

Since late 2021, I’ve been actively involved in bug bounty hunting, where I focus on identifying real-world security issues and helping organizations fix them before malicious actors can exploit them. My mission has always been clear: use my knowledge to make the digital world a safer place.

Through this blog, I aim to share insights, tools, techniques, and experiences from both my professional work and independent research, always with the goal of learning, growing, and giving back to the community.
