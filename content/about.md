Hi, My name is m1tz! I have been involved in the cyber security scene since 2019 and landed my first job as a **cyber security professional** in 2021. I ever was impressed about how things really work in the background and how someone could use that knowledge to break code and application logic. Thus, it was pretty clear to me that I have to be part of the white hat hackers and try to make the world a more secure place. This is why I started bug bounty hunting back then in end of 2021.
